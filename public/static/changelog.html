            <li>Remchi is now <b>open source</b>! Named OpenVUE, you can find the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Ryan778/OpenVUE">full source code on GitHub</a>.</li>
            <li>Complete refactoring of the Remchi core:</li>
            <ul class="browser-default">
              <li>This is the portion Remchi uses to communicate with Synergy, and it has been slowly accumulating bugs ever since its rocky start back in February 2019.</li>
              <li>By redoing it from scratch using modern APIs, it now <b>fully supports concurrent enrollment schools</b>, has <b>better caching and more detailed errors</b>, and is <b>significantly less prone to bugs</b>.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Redesigned dashboard:</li>
            <ul class="browser-default">
              <li>See the weather, date, and time (on desktop) at a glance</li>
              <li>Concurrently enrolled with another school? See all of your classes at once!</li>
              <li>Unobtrusive banner messages (in contrast to the obnoxious popups in the past)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Significantly better accessibility:</li>
            <ul class="browser-default">
              <li>Almost all of Remchi can now be navigated with just a keyboard!</li>
              <li>Better &quot;Reduced Motion&quot; setting removes even more optional animations</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Data Exporting:</li>
            <ul class="browser-default">
              <li>You can now download your grades in a variety of formats!</li>

            <li>Performance improvements:</li>
            <ul class="browser-default">
              <li>Code optimization and dead code cleanup means pages should load even faster than before</li>
              <li>The legacy, buggy course list loading system has been thrown out and replaced with a proper VueJS implementation</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Greatly improved &quot;Welcome&quot; carousel for the new user onboarding experience</li>
            <li>Lots and lots and lots of bug fixes:</li>
            <ul class="browser-default">
              <li>Far too many to list here, but they can be found in the full changelog!</li>

          <h4>Prerelease Build</h4>
          <ul class="browser-default">
            <li>Massive backend changes and cleanup in preparation for something still very much in progress. Without divulging too much, it&apos;s nothing that&apos;ll cause too much change for users, but was a) an end-goal since the start of this project and b) crucial to keeping Remchi alive after this year.</li>
            <li>Front-end <b>should</b> look and feel similar to before, but with much fewer issues. Please let me know if you encounter any bugs or errors!</li>
            <li>/export is now in a working state, and as such, can be tried out if you&apos;re intrested.</li>

        <ul class="browser-default">
          <li class="light-blue-text ascs bw"><b>Heads Up!</b> Due to the size of this release, some features have been partially rolling out to users since December. You may have already seen some of these new features!</li>
          <li><b>Thanks again to everyone who took the second survey!</b> Got lots of valuable feedback; check the <span class="light-blue-text bw">Roadmap</span> tab (under &quot;More Actions&quot;) to see the data.</li>

        <ul class="browser-default selectable">
          <li><b>GPA and Course History!</b> Very very heavily requested, but was rather difficult from a technological standpoint. But hey, it works now!</li>
          <li><b>Full What-If Support!</b> Not only can you edit any existing assignment, you can also add new ones now.</li>
          <li><b>New Pages</b>: Account and Full Changelog (/account and /changelog respectively). </li>
          <ul class="browser-default">
            <li>Use the &quot;Account&quot; page to see where you&apos;ve logged in, how often you check gradebook, and (as a bonus) how that compares to everyone else! Link in the &quot;More Actions&quot; dropdown. </li>
            <li>Changelog is pretty self-explanatory, link at the top of this dialog.</li>
            <li>Not technically new, but the landing page has been completely redone. Check it out sometime!</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Attendance Improvements</b>: The attendance page now features a calendar, with a dot on any day you have attendance marks.</li>
          <li><b>A Welcome Screen!</b> New users can choose to get a quick crash course now. Want to see it for yourself? Go to Settings -&gt; About -&gt; Show Welcome Screen.</li>
          <li><b>Any district support</b> which won&apos;t affect current users, but Remchi should now work with <b>any</b> district using Synergy!</li>

        <p><b class="bw yellow-text">Other Changes</b></p>
        <ul class="browser-default selectable">
          <li><b>A heaping pile</b> of bugfixes and optimizations. Feeling nerdy? A technical description of every change is listed under the new <a href="changelog/full">full changelog</a>. Here&apos;s some of the more notable ones: 
          </li>
          <ul class="browser-default">
            <li>Replaced the up arrow in a course with a left &quot;return&quot; arrow, since most people didn&apos;t use the up arrow.</li>
            <li>Pending items now a) show their total point value and b) can be directly used in Grade Calculator</li>
            <li>Remchi looks a lot better on mobile in general, especially on really small screens (where previously text was constantly cut off)</li>
            <li>Behind the scenes: Fixed a months-long issue with weird dropdowns on iOS, users being asked to sign in twice, gradebook not updating, and many other obscure (but critical) bugs.</li>
          </ul>

            <li><b>Thanks to everyone who took the survey!</b> The two most requested features were <b>trends and editing</b>, both of which are now features along with some other things.</li>
            <li><b>Trends!</b> See how your grade changed over time with the new Trends tool! Click/tap on the number to show your grade at the time.</li>
            <li><b>Editing!</b> See how changing your grade on a particular assignment (or two) affects your overall grade. You can even edit pending items!</li>
            <li><b>Pending indicators</b> which show ungraded items as &quot;pending&quot; rather than &quot;new&quot;- requested quite a bit in the past. These will switch to &quot;new&quot; once they&apos;re graded.</li>
            <li><b>Adaptive color scheme</b> matching your system&apos;s, so Remchi will be more consistent the rest of your platform.</li>
            <li><b>The URL is respected now</b>, so if you bookmark the link to a specific course, it&apos;ll actually work.</li>

            <li>Speaking of apps, you know there&apos;s an <a target="_blank" href="../app/install"><b>installable mobile app for Remchi</b></a>, right?</li>
            <li>This will likely be the last major open beta release before either moving into the prerelease / release phase! (There&apos;s a known issue with dropdowns behaving weirdly on iOS 13 that I&apos;d like to patch before full release)</li>

            <li><b>The sidebar has gotten a lot fuller!</b> Three new modules (detailed below) have been implemented, doubling what we previously had.</li>
            <li><b>Bell Schedules!</b> Currently for Fossil only, but great for getting yourself oriented with the new schedule. Even tells you how long you have left in a class!</li>
            <li><b>Attendance Records and Messages</b> - You won&apos;t need the other StudentVUE app to check these anymore!</li>
            <li><b>Custom backgrounds</b> so you can finally put your face on top of your grades. Or not. Doesn&apos;t matter, you have options now!</li>
            <li><b>Browser buttons work now</b> so pressing back will actually do what you&apos;d expect it to do. You can&apos;t bookmark a specific page quite yet - we&apos;re working on that!</li>

            <li><b>Extra credit assignments</b> are now more apparent than ever, and will simply say &quot;EC&quot;. </li>
            <li><b>Automatic app updates</b> so any installed apps will always be put on the latest version of Remchi... and it only updates the components needed so it&apos;ll usually take &lt;10 mb.</li>
            <li><b>Offline app use </b>which was half-implemented previously but only somewhat worked. You can now take your phone offline and still access your gradebook and bell schedule after loading it once!</li>

            <li><b>Many many bugs were fixed</b> between the previous major release and now, but we&apos;re certain there&apos;s more. Please let us know if you encounter any!</li>
            <li><b>Notifier is disabled</b> unless you were with us in the 2018-19 year. You can still request access manually, but the reason for this is in the next point.</li>
            <li><b>Significant changes in data handling (and our legal pages)</b> because while most students could care less about what info they give/store, district IT personnel have expressed potential concerns, and we&apos;re taking proactive measures to both collect as little data as possible and be extremely open in what we do collect. Specifics are detailed in our <a href="../legal#privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
            <li><b>We&apos;re almost out of Open Beta!</b> The big features envisioned last year are more or less complete now. After testing the big features a bit and smoothing out the smaller issues, we&apos;ll officially go into Build 1000!</li>
